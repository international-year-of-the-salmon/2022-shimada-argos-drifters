README

Welcome to the repository containing data sea surface temperature data from Argos satellite tracked drifters deployed from the Bell. M. Shimada during the International Year of the Salmon High Seas Expedition, 2022.

The repository is structured as follows:

original_data contains processed data files that have been sent to the IYS Data Scientists that have not been formatted to the IYS Data Template.

IYS_data_template contains the processed data files that have been provided in the IYS Data Template.

standardized_data contains the standardized data tables as they will be published to OBIS or ERDDAP.

scripts contains the code used to format the data files from either the original_data or IYS_data_template folder to the data tables as found in standardized_data.

docs contains any supplementary material, protocols, changelogs etc relevant for data interpretation.

Statement of Data Access:

Abstract:

SST and Position are provided for two satellite tracked Argos drifters that were deployed from the NOAAS Bell M. Shimada during the 2022 International Year of the Salmon Pan-Pacific Winter High Seas Expedition conducted from January-April 2022 utilizing 5 different research/fishing vessels. The objective of this expedition was to demonstrate the utility of an international pan-Pacific winter ecosystem survey to understand how increasingly extreme climate variability in the North Pacific Ocean and the associated changes in the physical environment influence the abundance, distribution, migration, and growth of Pacific salmon and surrounding species. This dataset includes sea surface temperature, latitude, longitude and time of two 40m drogued satellite tracked drifters which where released into the Alaskan Stream.

Protocols:

Data was spot validated for location and temperature inconsistencies.
